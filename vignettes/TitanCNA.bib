	Abstract = {Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number alteration (CNA) feature
	prominently in the somatic genomic landscape of tumors. As such,
	karyotypic aberrations in cancer genomes have been studied extensively
	to discover novel oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Advances
	in sequencing technology have enabled the cost-effective detection
	of tumor genome and transcriptome mutation events at single-base-pair
	resolution; however, computational methods for predicting segmental
	regions of LOH in this context are not yet fully explored. Consequently,
	whole transcriptome, nucleotide-level resolution analysis of monoallelic
	expression patterns associated with LOH has not yet been undertaken
	in cancer. We developed a novel approach for inference of LOH from
	paired tumor/normal sequence data and applied it to a cohort of 23
	triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) genomes. Following extensive
	benchmarking experiments, we describe the nucleotide-resolution landscape
	of LOH in TNBC and assess the consequent effect of LOH on the transcriptomes
	of these tumors using RNA-seq-derived measurements of allele-specific
	expression. We show that the majority of monoallelic expression in
	the transcriptomes of triple-negative breast cancer can be explained
	by genomic regions of LOH and establish an upper bound for monoallelic
	expression that may be explained by other tumor-specific modifications
	such as epigenetics or mutations. Monoallelically expressed genes
	associated with LOH reveal that cell cycle, homologous recombination
	and actin-cytoskeletal functions are putatively disrupted by LOH
	in TNBC. Finally, we show how inference of LOH can be used to interpret
	allele frequencies of somatic mutations and postulate on temporal
	ordering of mutations in the evolutionary history of these tumors.},

	Abstract = {GC content bias describes the dependence between fragment count (read coverage) and GC content found in Illumina sequencing data. This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.},
